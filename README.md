# My Portfoio
This Git Repo serves as a simple portfolio to hold some code projects that I want to show off.

Each folder contains a project, and the description for each project is in this readme.

In the future, I plan on building out my personal website to showcase my portfolio in a more interesting manner.

## B Tree
*C++*

This project shows off my work on my favorite language, C++.

B Trees are one of the most complex data structures I've worked with,
and I really enjoy building data structures like this from scratch.

**main file: btree.cpp**

## Collatz Conjecture
*Multiple Languages*

This projects shows off my experience with many different languages.

Each folder in this project represents a different programming language.
For each programming language, there is an iterative and recursive implementation
of the Collatz conjecture.

Programming languages deeply interest me, and I loved this project.

## Nim AI
*C++*

This project shows off a Naive AI that I bilt for the game of Nim.

The AI works off of playing thousands of simulated games of Nim and records
losing moves. I remember setting this off to run overnight on our server and
waking up to thousands of losing moves recorded.

## Simplex Method
*Python*

This project shows off my ability to do mathematical modeling with python.

Understanding the math behind the Simplex Method was quite the undertaking.
I'm not completely satsified with the results, but it was an interesting project.
